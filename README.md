## Data Model and API Description

In this inventory management app, you will be able to register new items to the product catalog, open new stores/warehouses (i.e., locations) in the network, and manage each location's inventory. The data model is developed that focus on the user stories as below.

- "As a product catalog manager, I want to add a new item to the product catalog or update an existing item in the catalog."
- "As a store manager, I want to add a new store to the network or update an existing store in the network."
- "As an inventory planning manager, I want to register an item to a store and set/adjust the inventory level of that item in that store."
- "As a customer, I want to check which stores offer the item that I to purchase."

See the documentation for the data model below.

### Item

An item holds information about a physical good, including item's name, SKU, and cost. Each item is associated to a unique user-specified ID, which is used to access item's information, retrieve its available locations, and query inventory level.

#### Sample Item

```
{
    _id : 61e269c75acfcdccb020bdad
    item_id : 2316457
    item_name : Crock-Pot 7-Quart Easy Clean Slow Cooker with Locking Lid
    sku : CPSCVC70LLEC-S
    cost : 49.99
    created_at : 2022-01-15T06:29:09.059+00:00
    updated_at : 2022-01-15T06:29:09.059+00:00
    __v : 0
}
```

#### Functionalities & Endpoints

- Register item to product catalog: `POST` `/api/items/create`
- Return a full list of product catalog: `GET` `/api/items/get/all`
- Display a list of items at a location: `GET` `/api/items/get?location_id=<location_id>`
- Display an item's attributes by ID: `GET` `/api/items/get/attributes?item_id=<item_id>`
- Modify an item's attributes: `POST` `/api/items/modify/:item_id`
- Remove item from product catalog and all locations: `POST` `/api/items/delete?item_id=<item_id>`

### Location

A location can be a store, a fulfillment center, or a warehouse. It essentially represents a geographical location that can store goods. Each location is associated to a unique user-specified ID and holds information such as store's name and address. The ID can be used to access the store's information, retrieve its items, and query inventory level.

Note: Please note that this documentation uses "location" synonymously for store, fulfillment center, and warehouse.

#### Sample Location

```
{
    _id : 61e262bf5acfcdccb020bd7d
    location_id : 4950
    location_name : Alpharetta
    address : 2855 Jordan Ct
    city : Alpharetta
    state : GA
    country : US
    zip : 30004

    updated_at : 2022-01-15T05:59:27.509+00:00
    __v :

```

#### Functionalities and Endpoints

- Remove a location from network and its inventory: `POST` `/api/locations/delete?location_id=<location_id>`

### Inventory

An inventory maps an item to a location and specifies the item's quantity at that location. Each inventory object must have a unique pair of location ID and item ID. This pair of IDs can be used to retrieve and update item's count.

#### Sample Inventory

```
{
    _id : 61e26cb91f95a96838d95053
    item_id : 2316457
